When you communicate this information, you accept that some of the data will be visible to the other users of our Platform, and therefore made public on the Platform.

However, information not marked as public will not be visible or accessible by other Users; such information is signaled as ‘private’ below.
  
//   Cuddi also collects and processes data relating to your registration and data relating to your interactions with Cuddi as is described in herein.
  
//           5.1.1.  Data Registration.
  
//     a)  Information required for registering:
  
//   This is the basic data required for you to register and access our Services. Such data is collected by Cuddi using different methods depending on the type of registration you choose.
  
//   If you choose to register using your Facebook, Apple or Google account, your data will be collected from the relevant platform in an effort to reduce formalism. By selecting “Login with Facebook/Apple/Google,” you agree to having these platforms provide us with such data. Do consider that while using any third-party platform you are subject to the terms and conditions and privacy policies of such third party-providers.
   
//   In addition, you can register using a mobile phone number and, if this is the case, your data will be sent to Cuddi directly by you. This data relates to your identity.

In all cases, your first name (public), age (public), birth date (private), gender, and at least one profile photo (public) are required to register on our Platform. Subsequently, you may add or remove profile photos at any time, providing you have added at least one profile photo containing a person’s face.

//   In addition, if you refuse the geolocation feature when registering, and thereby the possibility for Cuddi to collect your location data to suggest Member profiles proximity you must provide the name of your city. This information will enable Cuddi to suggest Member profiles near you.
  
//     b)  Optional information to complete your profile:
  
//   You may add additional information to improve your profile. This information is optional, shared at your own discretion, and is your sole responsibility. You can add this information directly to your profile on our Platform and/or via Facebook Connect by syncing your Account with Facebook. This data is as follows:
  
//       - Professional career and education (public): profession or studies;
  
//       - Interests and habits (public): personal preferences, leisure activities, musical preferences, lifestyle, Member Characteristics;

//   Your profile description is a free text area, Cuddi does not encourage Users to share data that can be perceived as sensitive with other Users, or with Cuddi through our Platform. Sensitive data refers to data that is legally qualified as “sensitive” by the applicable laws and regulations (e.g. information on race or ethnicity, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs or affiliation with a union, along with information on health, sexual life or sexual preferences). Please note that if you decide to share such sensitive information on your profile, such information is deemed to have been “clearly made public'' by you in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
  
//           5.1.2. Data relating to interactions with Cuddi.
  
//   When you contact our Support Service and report an issue with our Platform and its Services or ask for help as well as exercise your personal data rights, or participate in promotional activities or surveys, just as when you share your experience of our services, or give testimonies, or answer one of our questionnaires, Cuddi will collect, depending on the case, the following personal data:
  
//       a)  Data relating to reports and requests sent to our Support Service (private):
  
//           Date and time of the report, nature and reason for the report, data relating to the reported user. Furthermore, proof of identity may be requested as part of the exercise of your rights over your personal data, and for safety and/or confidentiality reasons.
   
//           This data will be collected by Cuddi when you ask for help from our Support Service, exercise your rights over your personal data and/or report a problem or another user. Such information is required to handle reports or answer your requests. This information will also be handled if a report is made about you. In fact, Cuddi has a legal obligation to collect reports from its Users brought to its knowledge regarding contents or behavior likely to infringe our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy.
  
        
//         5.2.  Data we collect automatically.
  
//   When you use our Services and features, we collect information on your activities on our Platform:
  
//   a)  Activity data (private):
  
//   When you access our Services and use our Platform and its features, information on the way you use them is collected and processed (e.g. registration date, login dates, on or offline status, interactions with other Users and/or third-party, number of transactions, notifications received, notification preferences, etc.). Most of the information collected by Cuddi is necessary to the provision of its Services. Without this data Cuddi cannot supply the Services linked to our Platform. 
  
//   More specifically, this includes your registration date, login dates, on or offline status, the type and number of interactions with other Users (such as messages, connects, gifting, likes and proximity), with the third-party accounts connected to your Account (such as Instagram), or the number of transactions made (purchases of promotions, subscriptions, pay per view, video chat services or subscriptions), notifications received and notification preferences.
  
//   b)  Geographical positions and proximity points with other Members (public):
  
//   The Platform’s main value and purpose is to allow our Users to find other Users within their proximity to interact with each other using our Services and features. Your Geographical position is collected with your express consent only. In fact, you will be asked to authorize the collection and processing of your location data to allow Cuddi to identify your proximity with other Users who have agreed to be geolocated.
  
//   Unless you have chosen stricter settings on your device, Cuddi will collect your Geographical position regularly.
  
//   When the Geographical positions of two Users are within a certain radius, Cuddi marks a proximity point. The proximity radius is defined by Cuddi. Members will only be able to see other Users locations when permission is given by the User.
  
//   During your registration, if you do not provide your consent for geolocation, you must provide the name of your city. This information will enable Cuddi to suggest profiles of Members near you.
  
//   These proximity points may be displayed as a news feed or on a Map (Mapping).
  
//   You may, at any time, withdraw your consent by disabling geolocation on your device. If you choose to do so, your newsfeed will no longer be updated, and you will not be able to see other Users within close proximity after disabling the geolocation option. When you have no more profiles in your newsfeed, we will ask you the name of your city in order to suggest new User profiles near you.
   
//   You may also ask that your profile, and therefore your crossing points, are no longer displayed on the Map (Mapping). In this case, you will only appear in the news feed of other Users. Equally, you will no longer be able to see the profiles of Users within close proximity on the Map (Mapping); you will only see these profiles on your news feed. For this, go to our Website or App and click on “My preferences” then go to the bottom of your screen and disable the option “Share my proximity radius”.
  
//   c)  Text messages and voice messages sent and received (private):
  
//   Messages are sent and stored on Cuddi’s servers, to provide the Service to allow Users with a Cuddi Connect to have a conversation or when an User uses the Gifting  function. Messages and voice messages are strictly private and only implicate the User involved. Cuddi’s authorized staff do not exercise any rights to view these conversations.These messages are not transmitted or communicated to third parties except in cases of judicial requests, and/or in compliance with the applicable legislative or regulatory provisions. Moreover, messages are strictly private and are not accessible to other Users who are not involved in the conversation, nor to any third party.
  
//   d)  Information relating to Video Calls (private):
  
//   If you wish to make a Video Call, your device’s technical data is required in order to establish communication between the Users (e.g. start and end time/date of calls, etc.). Cuddi will collect the start and end time/date of Video Calls, but not their content. Such Video Calls are instant.
  
//   e)  Search preferences - people whom you would like to cross paths with (private):
  
//   The Platform lets you set preferences by age, gender, and the Member Characteristics they have provided. You can change these settings in the Platform and specify the age range and Member Characteristics, and, after agreeing to Cuddi collecting and processing your data, the gender of people you are looking for, so you can be matched exclusively with profiles within your proximity with and who meet your search criteria. You will then only see the Users within your proximity range with and who share your search preferences.
  
//   f)  Technical data of your device (private):
  
//   We collect information from the devices and equipment you use to access our Services, including server logs, which may contain information such as IP addresses, version of the Website and App, device version and model, language used, operating system, Website and App crashes, and advertisement ID. Data may be collected with cookies or other tracking tools.
  
//   g)  Transaction Data:
  
//   Cuddi does not collect or process any banking data. Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store have opted to refrain from sending certain types of data to mobile applications, which includes any banking and financial information. This data is collected and processed solely by the above platforms, and Cuddi does not have the option of changing this payment method. The only information exchanged between Cuddi and Apple’s App Store or Google’s Play Store is technical data that does not allow us to identify you (for example, a transaction number), and is used to validate transactions. Cuddi will therefore retain a history of your purchases and subscriptions but will not store any information relating to the payment methods you use.
